# Client-Server Communication Using UDP and TCP Protocols
## Introduction
This program was developed as part of an assignment for the Computer Networks Laboratory course. The objective was to create an application with client and server components utilizing UDP and TCP communication. The clients communicate only with the server, which manages the communication between different pairs of clients.

The implementation was done in Python, using the native _*socket*_ and _*threading*_ libraries.

## Implementation
Both the client and server run within an App module to handle the logic, utilizing separate UDP and TCP classes to manage the communication protocols.
